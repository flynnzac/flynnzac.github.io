<p><b>Bounding long run treatment effects.</b></p>

<p>A key problem in experimentation: how can we learn about long-run impacts from short-run experiment results? Surrogacy methods impose very strong assumptions to get at a solution.  This blog posts looks at methods to relax those assumptions to get more robust bounds on long run effects.
