<p><b>Memo_er: Self-Service Analysis for Decision-Making not Chart-Making</b></p>

<p>
  <a href="https://memoer.io">Memo_er</a> is my project to create a convenient, self-service analysis tool, flexible enough to deal with all the analyses a data scientist would want to automate.  Instead of generating dashboards of charts, it generates memos, the standard output of data analysis, with automatically-generated explanations of the premises of the analysis and the conclusions.  Instead of SQL, Memo_er analyses are written in Python expanding the set of analyses you can automate relative to standard dashboarding tools.  It is also less expensive than a dashboarding system so it can work well for small teams or companies.</p>

<p>
  No more back and forth on "did we check this variation of the analysis?"  Every member of the team can try different variations of the analysis.
