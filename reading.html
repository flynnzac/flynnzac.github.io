    <p>I want to read more.  By "read", I mean non-economics papers. This page is a commitment device to help me read more.  I post what book I am reading and when I start it.  Presumably, I will feel great shame at seeing how long ago it was that I started a certain book and be moved to finish the book.

    <p>When I finish a book, I add a little review, and rate it out of five points.  My rating system is arbitrary, based on my whim and fancy, and final.
    
      <h3>What I am reading</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoyevsky (started: 2018-12-31).  (Somehow I missed this one in school, rectifying.)
      </ol>

      <h3>What I have read</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bad Blood by John Carreyou (5/5)
          <p>I listened to this book as an audiobook while driving back to Northern Virginia from Texas after visiting family for the holidays. It was marvelous.  Great writing, reads like the best True Crime.  I first read about the Theranos story when it broke in the WSJ when I was in grad school in Madison (As an aside, I only subscribed to the Journal because of its student discount rate, and I am now a full subscriber because I read it daily in grad school. Consider this my testimonial that student discounts can work.).  I read about it at Johnson Public House on Johnson Street. The story hooked me because of the sheer brazenness of the big lie, the stature of those taken in by the lie, and the ambiguous motivations of the liar.  I followed the story ever since, but I still learned new details from the book and hearing the whole story put together expertly (like the best thrillers) is a great experience.</p>

        <li>Zero to One by Peter Thiel (3.5/5)
          <p>The book was a short listen on audiobook while finishing the drive from Eastern Tennessee back to DC, and I had heard it had something to do with monopoly rents being the main driving force behind innovation (the point of the Schumpterian literature) and had some good war stories from Thiel's previous ventures.  The book was at its best when Thiel was discussing the kinds of businesses entreprenuers should look to start and more specific advice about how to start a business (I thought the discussion of whether to compensate with stock vs cash - Thiel is decidely in favor of stock - is probably worth discussing more at intersection of IO/labor economics from the perspective of a private company with unknown future prospects for being listed on public markets/being acquired). The war stories Thiel told about his prior experiences starting up businesses were engaging looks at how decisions are made in real businesses.</p>

          <p>The book was at its worst when it discussed economic theory and, more generally, academics (like physics). There is a vast theory literature in economics on the tradeoff between the toughness of competition and innovation, but the book claims economists somehow don't know about this and think perfect competition is always the "best" market structure (does he think all economists believe all patents are bad?), ignoring a vast literature on innovation and even just entry models in general that considers exactly that tradeoff (the toughness of ex-post competition reduces the incentive to innovate or enter the market in the first place). </p>
      </ol>
