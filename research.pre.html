          Paper proposes a simple way to get around convergence problems in logistic regressions and to deal with endogeneity in binary regressions that I've found to be very useful in practice. Especially useful for automated models where the estimates have to be produced automatically for a given dataset which is not known until runtime and you have to be sure the model converges. The method is useful, and it is worth trying if you encounter convergence issues or a model with endogenous covariates and a binary dependent variable.
