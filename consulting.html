  <p>I can help find solutions to your (business) problems with economics and data science!</p>

  <p>I have a PhD in Economics, and I've worked in both the technology industry and in litigation consulting.</p>

  <p>I have expertise in the following areas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Experimentation.</b> I have broad, extensive knowledge of experimentation. How to design experiments. How to analyze experiments. How to build an experiment-driven culture at the company. I've done significant original work in this space. My <a href="https://goodenoughstatistics.com">blog</a> has introduced new ideas in experimentation.</li>
    <li><b>Pricing.</b> I've built pricing models both for transactional products and subscription products at Udemy and Amazon. My pricing philosophy combines economic theory and data to incrementally improve prices, rather than jumping to some so-called optimal price. For one thing, it's not possible to find an optimal price for technical reasons (we are looking for a price better than what we've done before, so we can't have any data at the prices we're moving to, but to find the optimal price, we need global identification of the demand function, so we would need to see prices at the prices we're trying to move to, which we haven't tried before! See <a href="https://goodenoughstatistics.com/combining-structural-models-and-causal-inference-methods-a14da3332bd6">my blog post</a> for more details.) Also: the theoretical optimal price is constantly changing as demand and other factors fluctuate. A better approach is to focus our modeling on figuring out where we are under and over priced, adjust prices accordingly, and update our decisions as we get more data at the new prices.</li>
    <li><b>Product Analytics.</b> Statistical analysis that helps you understand your product and your customers better. My background in economics and varied experience has left with a very large toolkit and exposure to a broad variety of problems. If the solution to your problem involves analyzing data, I can help out.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Check out my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> for more on my background, feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/zlflynn">LinkedIn</a>, and I look forward to working with you!</p>



  <p>The project can be very small. Even if it's just something like: "We did this analysis. Can you just give us a second pair of eyes on it?" I'll take a look. Or: <b>"I just want to know if we're walking down the right path here. Can you give us your take on this idea we have?"</b> I'll give it.</p>

  <p>The easiest way to contact me about consulting work is to fill out the form below, and I'll get back to you!</p>
