  <p>I am an economist/statistics/data science person. I have a broad background in all sorts of data analysis. I have worked on projects from demand estimation to productivity measurement to subscription pricing problems to experiment analysis. See my <a href="cv.pdf">CV</a> for details on what I''`ve worked on.</p>

  <p>I currently work for <a href="udemy.com">Udemy</a>. I formerly worked for: <a href="http://compasslexecon.com">Compass Lexecon</a>, <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.afiniti.com">Afiniti</a>.  I got my PhD in economics from the <a href="http://econ.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.</p>

  <p>I am also a fan of the San Diego Padres and their annual quest to finish better than last place in the NL West.</p>
