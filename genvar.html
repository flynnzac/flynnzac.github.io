<p><b>Enable Stata-like data manipulation in R.</b></p>

<p>I wrote genvar, an R package, that introduces an imperative, Stata-like data manipulation/regression syntax to R.  The purpose of the project is to make the transition to R friendlier for people coming from fields that predominantly use Stata or other imperative data manipulation environments.  By imperative, I mean an environment where a series of commands are executed on a dataset to produce a result.</p>
