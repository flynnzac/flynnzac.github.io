<p><b>Measuring experiment success is a hard problem.</b></p>

<p>Establishing causality is easy with experiments.  That’s why they’re great!  But the problem of what variable specifically we want to look at decide whether an experiment’s outcome is “good” is a surprisingly difficult problem.</p>

<p>If we choose a metric that definitely indicates a win because it is an ultimate company metric (revenue, profit, etc), the experiment will have to run for a very long time because everything that affects our business moves the metric.  Separating the signal of our experiment from all that noise will take longer.  Speed matters.</p>

<p>So we want to choose a metric that is closer to the experiment.  But ultimately, it still needs to move our bottom-line goal metrics.  This balancing act makes choosing how to measure experiment success critical and difficult.</p>

<p>Basic rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Decide on the metric that defines success prior to the experiment.
  <li> Limit the number of metrics that define success so that decision-making is clear and well-specified prior to the experiment.
  <li> Reduce the set of metrics to consider to those that have a demonstrated relationship with an ultimate goal of the business (revenue, engagement, profit, etc).
  <li> Choose the metric most directly impacted by the experimental intervention from among this set.
</ol>
