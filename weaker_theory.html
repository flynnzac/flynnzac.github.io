<p><b>The weaker the theory, the more robust the results. The stronger the theory, the more meaningful the results.</b></p>

<p>When you use only a weak theory (weak assumptions), the problem in the analysis is: am I measuring the right thing?  When analyzing an experiment/difference-in-difference/synthetic controls/etc, one of the main questions is: am I looking at the right outcome variable?</p>

<p>When you use a strong theory (an explicit model, strong assumptions), the problem in the analysis is: are these assumptions <i>true</i>? But the problem of measurement is less difficult because the theory itself  proscribes the right metric.</p>
