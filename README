Workflow:

1. Edit the files *.pre.html.
2. Edit the header and footers by changing how they are defined in dblbckslsh.scm.
3. Headers and footers are put wherever \\HEADER and \\FOOTER are.
4. Type make to rebuild the *.html files.

See COPYING for license info for dblbckslsh.scm if you are actually interested in using this code for some reason.
