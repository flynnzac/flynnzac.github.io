  <h2>Tools On The Internet</h2>
  
  <p>Internet tools I've built to help with work and data analysis.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://remwrk.com">remwrk.com</a></h3>

  <center>
    <img src="remwrk.png" class="recessimage"/>
  </center>

  <p><a href="https://remwrk.com"><b>remwrk.com</b></a> helps you remember what you've done at work. It uses AI to summarize what you do into easy bullet points for your CV, a headline for LinkedIn, or even a professional bio. The writing quality of the output is AI-level, but it gives you a base to work from. Enjoy!</p>

  <h3><a href="https://samplesizer.com">samplesizer.com</a></h3>

    <img src="samplesizer.png" class="recessimage">
  </center>

  <p><a href="https://samplesizer.com"><b>samplesizer.com</b></a> (the best sample sizer) is a tool for finding the required sample size for experiments. Unlike all those other sites that do this, <a href="https://samplesizer.com">samplesizer.com</a> has all the bells and whistles and let's you find the sample size for complex experiment designs, including peeking and multiple treatments within the same experiments.</p>

  <p>For fun tech-stack stuff: this site is entirely written in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, using <a href="https://ambiorix.dev/">ambiorix</a>.</p>

  <p>Check it out at: <a href="https://samplesizer.com">https://samplesizer.com</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="https://stpwtch.com">stpwtch.com</a></h3>

    <img src="stpwtch.png" class="recessimage">
  </center>

  <p><a href="https://stpwtch.com">stpwtch</a> is a personal time-tracker sans frills and fluff that is focused on one thing: tracking time well. It has useful features to quickly edit time by moving the timer around with single button clicks. It produces handy-dandy reports (some in single button clicks, but it also allows for flexibly-defined output as needed). The reports all output to plain tables and CSV's, so they are easy to import into spreadsheets, send to other people/apps, and write little scripts to add your own processing.</p>

  <p>I initially wrote <b>stpwtch</b> for myself in early 2020 with no real intention of releasing it. At the time, I needed to track time for work, but I kept up the habit afterwards because tracking my time is the one productivity strategy that I've found really works. It's like counting calories. You already know the quadruple cheeseburger and endlessly scrolling Twitter/X aren't good for you, but putting a number on just how many calories and just how many hours does wonders for helping you improve.</p>

  <p>Anyway, at least one person has used <b>stpwtch</b> daily for a long time, and he finds it useful - I hope you will too!</p>

  <p>Check it out at: <a href="https://stpwtch.com">https://stpwtch.com</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Happy Tracking!</p>

  <h2>Computer Programs</h2>

  <p>These are programs you run on your computer &mdash; without a browser! Incredible!</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flynnzac/slobil">SLOBIL</a>, a programming language that makes it easy to write little interactive programs. Has support for multiple threads and lots of other neat things. Written in C.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flynnzac/leas">LEAS</a>, the little extensible accounting system. An extensible (with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Scheme</a>) double-entry accounting system for personal finances. Some fun things you can do: write scripts to fetch updated stock prices or estimated home values. Written in C + Guile Scheme.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flynnzac/articleml">ArticleML</a>, an XML dialect for writing math-y docs that outputs to HTML and MathML, perfect for viewing on the web. Written in C.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/flynnzac/pushmac">pushmac</a>, a stack-based macro language for templating text files. I use it to generate this website, for example. Written in C.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Archived Projects (no longer online)</h2>

    <h3>memoer.io</h3>

      <img src="memo_er.png" class="recessimage">
    </center>

    <p><b>Memo_er</b> is my project to create a convenient, self-service analysis tool, flexible enough to deal with all the analyses a data scientist would want to automate.  Instead of generating dashboards of charts, it generates memos, the standard output of data analysis, with automatically-generated explanations of the premises of the analysis and the conclusions.  Instead of SQL, Memo_er analyses are written in Python expanding the set of analyses you can automate relative to standard dashboarding tools.  It is also less expensive than a dashboarding system so it can work well for small teams or companies.</p>

    <p>No more back and forth on "did we check this variation of the analysis?"  Every member of the team can try different variations of the analysis.</p>

    <h3>fnsh_it</h3>

    <center>
      <img src="fnshit.png" class="recessimage">
    </center>

    <p><b>fnsh_it</b> is a tool for tracking progress towards goals. It's perfect for long projects that require a little bit of work each day to finish. Like writing the next great page-turner. Or running a thousand miles. Or benching a million pounds. <b>fnsh_it</b> gives you daily goals to reach your target.</p>

    <p>It starts off assuming that you want to more-or-less evenly-space out the work, but, over time, it uses statistics to learn what days you like to work more and adjusts the work schedule to fit yours. It accounts for how much variation you like in your day-to-day work load... and lets you procrastinate a little, if it thinks you'd like that.</p>

    <p>For fun tech-stack stuff: this site is entirely written in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which I think is fun. It uses <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> for estimating the model.</p>
