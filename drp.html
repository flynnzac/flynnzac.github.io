<p><b>Make decisions with scalar parameters.</b></p>

<p>Find a number that will drive the decision using clear theory, even if the theory has to be strong.  Never try to make a decision from multiple variables. Data <i>analysis</i> is about reducing the data to a number that tells you what you want to know.  Don't stop a little short and use hand-waving to "balance" multiple parameters.  Have good &mdash; or good enough &mdash; reasons for the parameter.  But choose one.</p>

<p>(This is a note for my future self who will undoubtedly forget and relearn this lesson.)</p>
