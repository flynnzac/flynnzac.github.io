      <button class="accordion">Estimating quantile treatments efficiently in experiments</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>When we run experiments, we look for ways to make them find results faster.  After all, it’s a business and speed matters.  Usually, we use a CUPED-like method.  But these methods only work for average treatment effects.  In this short blog post, I show how to do this for quantile treatment effects (spoiler: it’s not quantile regression, that does not work in this context).</p>

      <button class="accordion">Using automated memos instead of dashboards</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>You may have experience using dashboarding services like Tableau.  While useful for lots of data-tracking problems, these services are also often applied to display results for complex data analysis.  They prioritize visual display over content and context.  I think a better way to design self-service data analysis systems is by using a more literate system of dashboarding: Memos.  I wrote a Ruby on Rails app that implements something closer to how I think self-service data analysis should look.  Data scientists can write memo templates that automatically generate explanations and context for end users - and the generated memos can be edited with the user’s own comments!  Self-serve data analysis should be like normal data analysis, and normal data analysis involves more than SQL queries. </p>

      <button class="accordion">Measuring productivity</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Measuring productivity, how much a production plant produces for a fixed set of inputs, is a difficult problem.  It is difficult because more productive plants also demand different levels of the factors of production (labor, capital, materials, etc).  The simple relationship between output and inputs gives a misleading relationship.  Standard approaches to solve this problem require a heavy dose of theory, much of which is more about model estimation than using strong predictions from economic theory.  This paper develops a robust result from economic theory and shows how to use it to learn how productivity varies across plants.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Enable Stata-like data manipulation in R</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>I wrote genvar, an R package, that introduces an imperative, Stata-like data manipulation/regression syntax to R.  The purpose of the project is to make the transition to R friendlier for people coming from fields that predominantly use Stata or other imperative data manipulation environments.  By imperative, I mean an environment where a series of commands are executed on a dataset to produce a result.</p>
