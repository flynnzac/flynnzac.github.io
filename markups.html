<p><b>Measuring markups with production data (with Amit Gandhi and James Traina).</b></p>

<p><b>Abstract:</b> We show standard methods to estimate production functions do not identify markups.
  This nonidentification creates spurious skewness in estimated markup distributions.
  We also show that ex-ante structure on the returns to scale solves the identification
  problem. In US public firm data and in a Monte Carlo experiment, we find that
  applying constant returns to scale performs remarkably well and reduces the skewness
  in the markup distribution among public-firm by as much as half in comparison to
  nonidentified estimates. This results in half the efficiency losses in output and labor
  shares when calibrated to a recent macroeconomic model.
