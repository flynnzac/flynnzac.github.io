<p>Welcome to my website!  I am an economist. I currently work for <a href="http://compasslexecon.com">Compass Lexecon</a>, and I formerly worked for <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.afiniti.com">Afiniti</a>.  I got my PhD in economics from the <a href="http://econ.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.  This site has links to my academic work and my resume/CV.</p>

<p>My main fields of academic research are industrial organization, productivity, econometrics, and environmental economics. Recently, I have been working on some applied macroeconomics work as well, related to my more micro work on productivity choice.</p>

<p>I study the distribution of technology across firms and industries, how it has changed over time, and how policies affect it.  <i>Technology</i> in economics means <i>transformation</i> &mdash; a method of turning some goods and services into another good or service.  Some methods are better than others and we say these methods have greater <i>productivity</i>.  I study the distribution of productivity and how to recover it from data.</p>

<p>In industry work, I have experience doing everything from building models for pricing Amazon Prime to implementing empirical matching algorithms to efficiently match salespeople and customers.  See my CV for more info.</p>

<p>I am a fan of the San Diego Padres and their annual quest to finish better than last place in the NL West.</p>
