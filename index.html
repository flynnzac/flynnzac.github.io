    <p>Welcome to my website!  I am an economist. I currently work for <a href="http://www.afiniti.com">Afiniti</a>, and I formerly worked for <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>.  I got my PhD in economics from the <a href="http://econ.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.  This site is mainly about my academic work, but it also has links to software I've written that may be useful for others.</p>
    
    <p>My main field of research is industrial organization, and I dabble in econometrics.</p>

    <p>I study technology (transformation, a method of turning some goods and services into another good or service) and how policy affects it.  Specifically, I study how to learn production functions and cost functions --- which describe technology --- from data to do policy evaluation.  Recently, my applied work has focused on how environment and competition policy in the electricity industry affects the productivity of power plants.</p>

    <p>I am a fan of the San Diego Padres and their annual quest to finish better than last place in the NL West.  In 2018, they... did not succeed.</p>
