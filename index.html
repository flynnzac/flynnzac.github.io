    <p>Welcome to my website!  I am an economist. I currently work for <a href="http://www.afiniti.com">Afiniti</a>, and I formerly worked for <a href="http://amazon.com">Amazon</a>.  I got my PhD in economics from the <a href="http://econ.wisc.edu">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a>.  This site is about my academic work.</p>
    
    <p>My main fields of research are industrial organization, econometrics, and environmental economics.</p>

    <p>I study the distribution of technology across firms and industries, how it has changed over time, and how policies affect it.  <i>Technology</i> in economics means <i>transformation</i> --- a method of turning some goods and services into another good or service.  Some methods are better than others and we say these methods have greater <i>productivity</i>.  I study the distribution of productivity and how to recover it from data. Specifically, I study how to identify production functions and cost functions --- which describe technology --- from data to evaluate how policies affect productivity.  Recently, some of my applied work has focused on how environmental and competition policy in the electricity industry affects the productivity of power plants.</p>

    <p>I am a fan of the San Diego Padres and their annual quest to finish better than last place in the NL West.  In 2018, they... did not succeed.</p>
