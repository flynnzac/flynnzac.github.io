        <p>I am an <b>Economist</b> and <b>Data Scientist</b>.  I use data to learn what people want and how best to provide it.  I analyze experiments, estimate demand and supply, and build models to inform product design decisions.  I have worked in the technology industry (Amazon, Udemy, Afiniti) and in litigation consulting (Compass Lexecon). I have a PhD in Economics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.</p>

        <p>Good data analysis combines <b>theory</b> and <b>statistics</b>.</p>

        <p><b>Theory</b> models how the real world generates the data, whether by the choices people make or by random assignment in an experiment.  Theory also tells us what metrics matter for success and gives insight on what improvements we might make to our products.  Theory is our model of the world and the lens through which we interpret data.</p>

        <p><b>Statistics</b> listens to what the data says, independent of a model. Statistics summarizes the data as it is.</p>
        
        <p>Statistics alone rarely answers an interesting question.  It can never show what causes what.  But statistics combined with theory is a powerful tool.</p>

        <p><b>I try to do good data analysis and build tools to help others do so.</b></p>
