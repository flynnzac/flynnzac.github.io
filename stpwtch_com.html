<p><b>stpwtch.com: for knowing where the time went</b></p>

<p><a href="https://stpwtch.com">stpwtch</a> is a personal time-tracker sans frills and fluff that is focused on one thing: tracking time well. It has useful features to quickly edit time by moving the timer around with single button clicks. It produces handy-dandy reports (some in single button clicks, but it also allows for flexibly-defined output as needed). The reports all output to plain tables and CSV's, so they are easy to import into spreadsheets, send to other people/apps, and write little scripts to add your own processing.</p>

<p>I initially wrote <b>stpwtch</b> for myself about five years ago with no real intention of releasing it. At the time, I needed to track time for work, but I kept up the habit afterwards because tracking my time is the one productivity strategy that I've found really works. It's like counting calories. You already know the quadruple cheeseburger and endlessly scrolling Twitter/X aren't good for you, but putting a number on just how many calories and just how many hours does wonders for helping you improve.</p>

<p>Anyway, at least one person has used <b>stpwtch</b> daily for a long time, and he finds it useful - I hope you will too!</p>

<p>I wrote a post about it as well on my <a href="https://medium.com/@zlflynn/time-tracking-and-stpwtch-a-tool-for-knowing-where-the-time-went-bd10e61c91d0">Medium</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Tracking!</p>
