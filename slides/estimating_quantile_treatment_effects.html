<p><b>Estimating quantile treatments efficiently in experiments.</b></p>

<p>When we run experiments, we look for ways to make them find results faster.  After all, it’s a business and speed matters.  Usually, we use a CUPED-like method.  But these methods only work for average treatment effects.  In this short blog post, I show how to do this for quantile treatment effects (spoiler: it’s not quantile regression, that does not work in this context).</p>
