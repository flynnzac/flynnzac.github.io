<p><b>SLOBIL: SLot and Object-Based Interactive Language.</b></p>

<p>On the bus to work in DC (circa 2018), I started writing a programming language that I thought would work well for quickly spinning up interactive programs... and would make the bus ride less boring. It has gotten seriously out of hand and now has a prototype-based object system, multi-tasking, etc.  Practically, it's a quick way to spin up a small program that needs to be interactive. I've used it to write several programs to organize myself, keep track of hours, and keeping track of money. It's also just fun to write.</p>
