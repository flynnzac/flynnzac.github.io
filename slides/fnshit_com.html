<p><b>fnshit.com: for getting long jobs done</b></p>

<p><a href="https://fnshit.com"><b>fnsh_it</b></a> is a tool for tracking progress towards goals. It's perfect for long projects that require a little bit of work each day to finish. Like writing the next great page-turner. Or running a thousand miles. Or benching a million pounds. <b>fnsh_it</b> gives you daily goals to reach your target.</p>

<p>It starts off assuming that you want to more-or-less evenly-space out the work, but, over time, it uses statistics to learn what days you like to work more and adjusts the work schedule to fit yours. It accounts for how much variation you like in your day-to-day work load... and lets you procrastinate a little, if it thinks you'd like that.</p>

<p>For fun tech-stack stuff: this site is entirely written in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, which I think is fun. It uses <a href="https://mc-stan.org/">Stan</a> for estimating the model.</p>
