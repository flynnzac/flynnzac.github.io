<p><b>Failed experiments are the value of experimentation.</b></p>

<p>When we develop a new product feature, we think it is a good thing.  Why else would we build it?  So, without experimentation, we would launch our new feature.</p>

<p>If the experiment wins, then we just do what we would have done anyway.  So experimentation provides no (ex-post) value.</p>

<p>If the experiment loses, then we do not launch the feature.  Now the experiment provides value because it changes our decision.</p>

<p>So experiments are valuable when they lose not when they win.</p>
